this an exampe how to save java class in mysql database
Hi,<br>
This is an example how to link java Classes to mysql.<br>
I workerd in a jpa project using maven.<br>
The main idea:<br>
There is a Student with a list of  Mark  (build like we usualy do in java) but this time we want to save it on my sqldb.
Before to do this i create a database in my sql and i linked the project with the database, IMPORTANT i haven't create anytable they will be created automatically<br>
I worked on netbeans with maven, i used a mysql database on xampp.<br>
In case of question ask to me!
